# Welcome!

Welcome to the repository for pi3, a compiled, statically-typed, C-like programming language written in [SRC_LANG] and distributed under the MIT license. It is developed by Liam Spillane, and its source code can be found at https://github.com/LiamSpillane/pi3.

# Background

This project was inspired by a series of assignments I completed in my undergrad, in which we implemented an extremely simple compiler. That compiler only had the capabilities of performing basic mathematical operations, storing a maximum of 50 variables, and printing to the terminal.

My long-term goal for pi3 is to get it to the point where I could viably write and compile an interpreter for a higher-level language. Short-term, though, I just want to learn more about language design and improve my overall understanding of how compilers function.

This project is still very early on in its development, but I plan to make regular contributions as I find the time.
